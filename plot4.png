I had an issue with GitHub that I could not solve with over 2 hours of research.  If anyone can help me figure that out, it would be great.
In the meantime, below are screenshots of the graphs I produced.

The error code does point out one file being too large:  
I do not know why that file was being pushed, as it was not in my repo (it had been, but had been removed and added to the .gitignore)
Also, when I've had that problem in the past it has just skipped that file.  Not stopped the entire push.

I think the real culprit is the "pre-receive hook declined" that everyone I've heard said normally happened when pushing to a protected branch.
This branch is not protected.
